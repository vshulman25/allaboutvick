                                This app is designed to assist people signing up for their COVID-19 vaccine. 
                                There is a sign up page for the user to input their information, including name, email, state of residence as well as verifying their age and if they are an essential worker.
                                This information is then stored in a database. 
                                After the user is signed up, they are taken to a page that displays their state's statistics concerning COVID-19. If the user is eligible for the vaccine, 
                                there will be an embedded map with the closest vaccine clinic.

                              on styling as well as functionality.

                               "So, you think you know code?" was one of the most challenging assignments yet one of the most rewarding.
                                There are so many aspects to getting this code to run properly, from the timer to the high score document and styling.
                                It took many hours of work to accomplish and I am quite proud of the outcome.
